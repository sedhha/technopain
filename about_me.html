    I am Shivam, Nice to meet you all. I am a design engineer and product
    developer with a decent amount of interest in science fiction and
    creative writing. Science and technology is something which has fascinated
    me from my childhood, I am a really strong believer of Mathematics and
    think that this entire universe is a mathematical model of various
    functions and variables. Many existing phenomena in nature can now
    easily be governed by present knowledge of mathematics and
    I believe many of them are yet to be discovered.
    <br><br>

    Apart from scientific theories, I am also interested in exploring
    philosophy, ancient civilizations, god and its existence etc.
    I am a fiction science writer and love to write and discuss
    possibilities and existence of such things, my thinking pushes
    me to a zone where whatever I start imagining is something which may
    sound completely absurd to you and you might have never thought of that
    particular perspective of defining the world and this universe. LOL!
    <br><br>
    Anyways, if you feel like I could assist or help you with anything,
    or even if you want to discuss or stay in touch feel free to message
    me via any of the communication modes I have added in my contacts tab.
    <br><br>
    I have some good experience in the technical areas of these domains:
