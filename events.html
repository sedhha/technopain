      There are so many things which affects us to be the person we are today,
      We can take many decisions about ourselves based on the outcomes
      observed and we get molded by time, but environment plays a very
      important role in molding ourselves, we see around observe things and
      then modify ourselves accordingly to be the very best versions of
      ourselves.
      <br>
      Similarly, as an engineering students, we go through many events,
      conferences, contests etc. which helps us to identify the field of
      application of whatever we learn in our classes or labs. Apart from them,
      we also become parts of some talks, social events, NGO involvement which
      also allows us to be part of the society and not isolated from it as
      those things are also important elements of life. Here are some of the
      memories, I made as a student in the events I participated, I hope you
      will find them interesting.

      So speaking about my engineering career, It all started from my first
      year at vellore Institute of Technology. Before joining the college,
      I was a bookworm and theoretical bug and would have never thought of
      applying all what I knew to the practical world.

      So this was the orientation day, seeing so many students coming from
      far by places here to study was one of the motivation for me as well
      to do well here. I was excited as well as scared at the same time.
      <br>
      And here we go:

      This was the first racing car expo in our college, this was
      something which just turned my senses to begin with doing something
      practical and turned things around for me. Here is what they made:

      <br>
      After all this, I joined a space
      robotics exploration
      team: <a href="http://teamroverx.com/">Team RoverX</a>.
      <br>
      I was always passionate about space science and Exploration,
      and after joining RoverX this interest got a direction, I worked almost
      2.5 years designing mechanical subsystems, and instrumental architecture
      of a rover to explore a Martian like atmosphere in search of its geology,
      geography and astrobiology.

      Apart from all this, I have been part of many other events, such as
      NASA space apps, HoneyWell WeHack 2.0 (As an student organizer), LVPEI
      eye care hackathon, ASME design challenge, ASME Mechanical conference,
      ASME Asia pacific E-fest, University Rover Challenge (2018 &
      2019 edition), Summer BioFest, Indian Rover Challenge,
      Aakruti Design Innovation challenge, HackHarvard 2018 etc.
      Here are the images of some of those beautiful memories I made,
      by being part of such events.
