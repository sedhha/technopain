    <p>As a passionate writer, here are the things I have been writing about.
      For some time, I was a standalone writer, and then I began writing as an
      intern for professional platforms and newspaper startups like
      <a href="https://wrytin.com/shivamsahil">Wrytin</a> and
      <a href="https://delhispeaking.in/">Delhi Speaking</a>.
      <br>
      After gaining some good writing experience with these industries,
      I’ll soon resume my blogging. Though, you can look for some of my
      WordPress blogs here:</p>
