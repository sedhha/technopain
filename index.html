    Hi Folks!
    I am Shivam and glad to see you here. I am a design engineer with 3+ years of
    work experience in technological projects and business marketing.<br>
    Science and mathematics are the two most prominent elements in my life,
    and I keep wondering about how precisely they govern the dynamics of
    this Universe.<br>

    I love to explore the Universe from the vision of scientific theories
    and mathematical equations and try to correlate them to unveil the
    cryptic mysteries of this Universe.
    <br>
    In most of my individual and group projects, I have worked as a
    <strong>designer,programmer, and innovator.</strong>
    I try to explore the possibilities and utility
    of a particular product or device and look for its best applications to
    create any beneficial entity.
    <br>
    A hectic life of engineering student has never isolated me from my passion
    for writing. I have worked with new media and newspaper startups and helped
    them create hundreds of superbly written and well-crafted contents for
    their clients and visitors.
    <br>
    Apart from engineering and writing, I am well experienced with video editing,
    presentations, animations, graphical designing, and Digital Marketing.
    Moreover swimming and sporting is also a crucial part of my life.
