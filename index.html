    Hi Folks!<br><br>
    I am Shivam, and glad to see you on this website. I am a tech freak who has
    worked in fields of robotics, instrumentation and automation. From the last
    six months, I have started exploring designing and digital marketing.
    <br><br>
    Science and mathematics are the two most prominent elements in my life, and
    I keep wondering about how precisely they govern the dynamics of this
    Universe. I love to explore the Universe from the vision of scientific
    theories and mathematical equations and try to correlate them to unveil
    the cryptic mysteries of this Universe.
  </h5>

  <img class="LargeScaleImage" src="pictures/p1bg1.jpg" alt="Image Error X_X">
  <br>
  <h5 class="GeneralParas">
    In most of my individual and group projects, I have served as a designer,
    programmer, and innovator. I love to dive in deep and explore the things
    which never exist in the first place.<br><br>
    A hectic life of engineering student has never detached me from my passion
    for writing. I have worked with new media and newspaper startups and helped
    them create hundreds of superbly written and well-crafted contents for their
    clients and visitors. Despite being a tech freak, I won't mind proceeding
    my career as a science fiction writer.<br><br>
    Apart from engineering and writing, I am well versed with video editing,
    presentations, animations, graphical designing, and Digital Marketing.
    Moreover swimming and sporting is also a crucial part of my life.<br>
