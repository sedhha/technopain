    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
    <hr>
    <br><br>
    <p>Modern-day technical advancements are something which has
      actively engaged me to keep wondering about them and look if
      they can be reinvented and innovated for simplification of
      any real-world problem.
      <br>
      And so here are some of my updated technical projects.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="http://bit.ly/2Lw1T7K">OPTIMIZING EXPOSURE TO
      INTERGALACTIC RADIATIONS IN FLIGHTS TRAVELING FROM POLES</a>
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      In Nasa space apps 2017, I worked on a project where the aim was to
      reduce the overall intergalactic radiation dosage using smart materials
      and algorithms. As a team of 3 people, we used the NASA database to
      create a functional relationship between a given altitude to which the
      airplane is flying with penetration power of cosmic rays to that particular
      altitude, based on this the flight algorithms could be altered to the
      safest path.

    <h2>WHEGGED ROBOT</h2>
    <br>
    <p>A robot which can have the features of wheels, as well as the legs, is
      whegged robot. We as a team of three created single actuated moving robot
      which could easily be used to walk over any terrains. The robot had its
      self-balancing tail which prevented it from toppling. In addition to this,
      the design was made small and compact so that it could easily be moved
      and tested.</p>

      <h2>COMPUTER VISION AND INSTRUMENTATION
         TECHNIQUES IN SOIL INSPECTION</h2>
         <br>
      <p>Using modern-day microcontrollers and microprocessors
        embedded with environmental sensors and a small digital camera,
        I embedded them together to give their combined data and infer it
        into meaningful information. Using all this a simple dnn algorithm
        is used to predict the best-suited crop along with the
        required resources.

      <h2>HP MARS CIVILIZATION CHALLENGE</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The most sustainable technologies to be adapted to make Mars
        home was the aim of this project. After extensive research and
        studies, I came up with some devices that can be highly helpful
        and how to take advantage of martian resources to use it to
        our benefit.

      <p>
        Using computer vision and object detection algorithms a virtual
        environment around the person was created, the data received was
        converted into other signals to obtain and produce the sensation
        of their environment to people with low or no vision.

      <h2>INVISIBILITY TALKING CAMERA WITH PYTHON</h2>
      <p>
        A Harry Potter invisibility cloak inspired me to work on making
        cool invisibility virtualization, It allows any particular object
        in the frame to act as invisibility cloak, after adjusting the filters.

         LUBRICATION SYSTEM IN HEAVY MACHINERY</a>
       </h2>
       <p>
         In this project, the focus was majorly on two properties of nanofluid:
      </p>
         <br>
         <ol>
           <li>Temperature Variation</li>
           and
           <li>Lubrication.</li>
         </ol>
         <img src="images/pr_i26.jpg" alt="Nanofluid synthesis process">
         <br>
         <p>
           The nanofluid was synthesized using Aluminium oxide
           powder and two different solvents were used to have
           a wide range of comparison.
         </p>
         <img src="images/pr_i26.jpg" alt="Nanofluid synthesis process">
         <p>
           Once the nanofluid was prepared, a set of spur gear driven by
           a DC motor of 10 rpm was used and lubrication was applied to
           observe the wearing and friction effects.

           OBTAIN MOST EFFICIENT AUTOMOBILE STRUCTURE</a>
         </h2>
         <p>
           Generative Design is basically designing performed by a computer,
           based on some selective parameters which enable the user, to
           constraint them and perform iterations by intuitive AI to
           obtain creative, new and designs beyond human imagination.
         </p>
         <img src="images/pr_i29.jpg" alt="Generative Design demonstration">
         <p>
           In this project, I fixed certain parameters like the
           frontal area, overall weight, ground clearance, wheel diameter,
           etc. Since the generative design concept is new to SolidWorks,
           I used SolidWorks equation modeler to change various
           parameters without breaking the constraints.
         </p>
         <img src="images/pr_i30.jpg" alt="Generative Design demonstration">
         <p>
           After varying equation parameters and generating 15 designs,
           they all were imported in Ansys to perform structural simulation
           and computational fluid dynamics to obtain the fittest design of all.
           <br>
           Later, I re-modeled the same setup in Fusion 360 and this
           time generated even more structures. These are one of the primitive
           projects I have worked upon apart from these, there are many other
           small projects which I have completed, let me know if you would
           like to explore them as well.
